## 🔄 How the Roulette Wheel Works

The **roulette wheel** is divided into numbered slots ranging from **0 to 36** (and sometimes **00**). A small ball is spun in the opposite direction of the wheel’s rotation, and wherever the ball lands determines the outcome.

### Key Components:
- **Numbers**: 0–36 (European), 0–36 + 00 (American)
- **Colors**: Red and Black (alternating), 0 and 00 are Green
- **Betting Layout**: Inside bets (straight, split, corner), Outside bets (odd/even, red/black, high/low)

🧮 The house edge varies depending on the type of roulette wheel, which is why it's crucial to know the differences.
